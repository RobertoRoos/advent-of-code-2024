# Advent of Code 2024 - by Robert

This repo contains my solutions to the advent of code of last Christmas.

## Approach

Last year (I got about halfway) I felt I was repeating myself so much, so now I want to also maintain some shared code.
I imagine this could be classes for coordinates, queues, etc.

I also want to code to run more cleanly, so I think I'll make each solution a CLI program, with a .txt file as input.
And as some code is to be shared I'll need some unit tests to make sure everything keeps running.
I will keep my personalized challenge inputs out of this repo though.
